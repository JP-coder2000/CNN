# AI-Generated Image Detection Project  

## Description  
This project implements a deep learning model to classify images as either AI-generated or real (photographs/traditional art). The system uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify subtle patterns that differentiate images created by generative algorithms from those captured or crafted by humans.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of **60,000 balanced images**:
